description from course

Within this course, youâ€™ll learn about how PostgreSQL creates and uses inverted indexes for JSON and natural language content. We will use various sources of data for our databases, including access to an online API and spidering its data and storing the data in a JSON column in PostgreSQL.  Students will explore how full-text inverted indexes are structured.  Students will build their own inverted indexes and then make use of PostgreSQL built-in capabilities to support full-text indexes.
